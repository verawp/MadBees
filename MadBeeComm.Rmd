## Bee Community Data

This report includes the statistical analyses used to understand the influence of landscape composition and land use history on bee community diversity across a rapidly-growing midwestern american city.  Bees sampled in passive traps known as bee bowls six times across the City of Madison in 2013.

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Madison Urban Bees")
MadBees<-read.csv('MadBeesBeeBowlsFinal.csv')
xy<-read.csv("xy.csv")
names(MadBees)
```

## Data summary

The unique bee species identified in the samples include:

```{r echo=FALSE}
sort(unique(MadBees$Morphospecies))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
